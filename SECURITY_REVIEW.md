# Security Review Report

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented and recommendations for the Ethiopian Orthodox Church website.

## Security Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Input Validation & Sanitization

- ✅ Added comprehensive input validation for donation amounts ($1-$10,000 limit)
- ✅ Email format validation using regex patterns
- ✅ String length limits to prevent buffer overflow attacks
- ✅ HTML content sanitization to prevent XSS attacks
- ✅ Donation type and purpose validation against allowed values

### 2. API Security

- ✅ CORS headers properly configured
- ✅ Security headers added (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- ✅ Rate limiting implementation for API endpoints
- ✅ Error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information
- ✅ Input sanitization utilities in shared functions

### 3. Database Security

- ✅ Supabase RLS (Row Level Security) policies in place
- ✅ Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- ✅ Proper authentication and authorization flows
- ✅ Environment variables for sensitive configuration

### 4. Payment Security

- ✅ Stripe integration with secure checkout sessions
- ✅ No sensitive payment data stored locally
- ✅ PCI DSS compliance through Stripe
- ✅ Webhook signature verification (recommended)

## Security Recommendations

### High Priority

1. **Implement Webhook Signature Verification**

   - Verify Stripe webhook signatures to prevent tampering
   - Add STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET environment variable

2. **Add Request Logging**

   - Log all API requests for audit purposes
   - Monitor for suspicious activity patterns

3. **Implement HTTPS Enforcement**
   - Ensure all traffic is encrypted in transit
   - Add HSTS headers for enhanced security

### Medium Priority

1. **Add Content Security Policy (CSP)**

   - Prevent XSS attacks through strict CSP headers
   - Currently basic CSP is implemented

2. **Implement Session Management**

   - Add proper session timeout handling
   - Implement secure logout functionality

3. **Add Backup and Recovery**
   - Regular database backups
   - Disaster recovery procedures

### Low Priority

1. **Add Security Monitoring**

   - Implement intrusion detection
   - Set up security alerts for unusual activity

2. **Regular Security Audits**
   - Schedule periodic security reviews
   - Update dependencies regularly

## Environment Variables Security

### Required Environment Variables

```
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_service_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret (recommended)
```

### Security Notes

- Never commit environment variables to version control
- Use different keys for development and production
- Rotate keys regularly
- Monitor key usage for anomalies

## Testing Recommendations

### Security Testing

1. **Input Validation Testing**

   - Test with malicious inputs (XSS, SQL injection attempts)
   - Test with oversized inputs
   - Test with invalid data types

2. **Authentication Testing**

   - Test unauthorized access attempts
   - Test session management
   - Test password policies

3. **API Security Testing**
   - Test rate limiting effectiveness
   - Test CORS configuration
   - Test error handling

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Protection

- GDPR compliance for EU visitors
- CCPA compliance for California residents
- Proper data retention policies
- User consent management

### Financial Compliance

- PCI DSS compliance through Stripe
- Proper financial record keeping
- Audit trail for all transactions

## Incident Response Plan

1. **Detection**: Monitor logs and alerts
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate severity and impact
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
5. **Lessons Learned**: Update security measures
